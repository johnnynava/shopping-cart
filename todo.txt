Changes I want to do later:
  hiPrio: Make use of Layout routes so that the Header doesn't need to render inside every content component (I had to do this because of the link references)
  midPrio: Make use of :product-name or something like that for the url path of each product in ProductDetail
  midPrio: create tests

- Make animations for:
  - Make every pages principal image fade into the bottom (black/content)
  - In the case of the product detail page, make it fade into the right and a bit down
  - When you hover on an item, make it so that it shows the name on a slight black border, that the image gets zoomed a little and the price gets a white background
-Make alert for when a user tries to add a fourth item of the same item in the product detail page

Notes: 
I think the header is re-rendering every time a component loads so fix that with better routing (layout routes?)
